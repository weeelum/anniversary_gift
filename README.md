# anniversary_gift
a little anniversary gift for my girlfriend, and technically the first game (and fully-functional program) I'll have ever created.

it's a little questionnaire game with 15 questions, each of which will loop until the correct answer is typed in. after each question, the player will be granted a varying number of kisses as a reward, and those kisses are then added to the "kiss bank". a correct answer will also reveal a song. after the player has answered all the questions correctly, they will be prompted to end the game, at which point the entire song "playlist" will print out via a loop.

and that's the gist of it! take a peek, and have fun!

p.s. more features to be added in the future.
