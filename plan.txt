1. finish changing "while 'state'" to "while True" ✅

2. although each question is unique, it should be fine to abstract away
the messages in question ✅

3. abstract this away: q_list[0].display_choice_qstn() at beginning of
each question ✅

4. abstract this away: player_q0_answer = q_list[0].choose_answer() with
a return value for player_q0_answer (this one didn't seem to work) ❌

5. abstract all this away into one function, update_kisses(kisses) or
something like that:      
    add_kisses(1)
    display_kiss_balance()
    append_kiss(1) ✅

6. abstract this away into a song(num) function:
    song_list[0].display_song()
    print(
        "\nThis song is how I sometimes feel when we sit together "
        "in silence. Enjoy!\n\n"
        "Now, for a hard one. 😈"
    )
and move the string's last sentence into the next abstracted portion
where we choose to advance to next question. ✅

7. for the display_playlist() function at the end, create a list of song
dictionaries to loop through, instead of trying to loop through a bunch
of class instances. ✅
