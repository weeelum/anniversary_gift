Hey Gabby. Happy anniversary! I can't believe it's been a whole 
year since we met in person! And what a year it has been already. Things 
have been hard, but things have also been very good. Remember the first 
kava place we went to? I still think about how they gave us free kava. 
Hehehe. I also remember that you had a really cute outfit on: medium 
wash jeans, Doc Martens, and a purple t-shirt.

So...your gift is a playlist! Sort of. Here's how it works, and it's 
quite simple:

Answer each question to unlock one song. That's it! Don't worry, these 
questions shouldn't be too difficult ðŸ˜›
Once you reach the end, the program will print out a list of the songs 
that you can then add to Spotify. I've included a fun little image you
can use as playlist artwork (this is non-negotiable; you MUST use it. I 
will check your work.)
